Breast Cancer Detection using PCA and Logistic Regression

This project addresses SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, specifically focusing on the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Breast cancer is a major global health concern, and timely detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and reducing mortality rates. By utilizing machine learning techniques, this project aims to contribute to the achievement of SDG 3 by providing a more accurate and efficient method for diagnosing breast cancer.

Alignment with SDG 3

1. Reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.
This project directly contributes to this target by improving the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis, which can lead to earlier and more effective treatment, ultimately reducing premature mortality.

2. Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.
This project can potentially enhance access to quality healthcare services by providing a cost-effective and efficient tool for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. This increased access can improve early detection rates, especially in resource-constrained settings.
By leveraging data science and machine learning, this project has the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of SDG 3 and improve the overall health and well-being of individuals affected by breast cancer.

This project provides an accuracy of 97.3%
